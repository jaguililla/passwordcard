h1. About

This is a GUI tool for security password cards. The application adds a tray icon which allow you to display a password card in the screen.

The original Web site, Android application and algorithm implementation (source code and binary) can be found at: "www.passwordcard.org":http://www.passwordcard.org.

* Packaging: mvn -P optimize
* Run: java -jar passwordcard.jar <properties_path>
* Exit: press the middle mouse button over the tray icon.
* Configuration: see the passwordcard.properties file as a reference to create your own configuration.

The source code and the program's output are encoded in UTF-8.
