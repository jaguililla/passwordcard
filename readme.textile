h1. About

This is a GUI tool for security password cards. The application adds a tray icon which allow you to display a password card in the screen.

The original Web site, Android application and algorithm implementation (source code and binary) can be found at: "www.passwordcard.org":http://www.passwordcard.org.

h1. Usage

The project uses Maven for building. And a configuration file/resource. These are the most useful commands to start working with it:

* Packaging: mvn -P optimize
* Run: java -jar passwordcard.jar <properties_path>
* Exit: press the middle mouse button over the tray icon.
* Configuration: see the passwordcard.properties file as a reference to create your own configuration.

For more information you can refer to the original README file.

h1. Prerequisites

To compile the project you will need JDK 7. Also to build the project you will need Maven 3, you can also use Maven 2 modifying the POM (that's up to you).

Though I have not tested it, maybe you can run the binary using JRE 6, however this way won't allow the use of rounded window corners.
