h1. About

This is a GUI tool for security password cards. The application adds a tray icon which allow you to display a password card in the screen.

The original Web site, Android application and algorithm implementation (source code and binary) can be found at: "www.passwordcard.org":http://www.passwordcard.org.

h1. Usage

The project uses Maven for building. And a configuration file/resource. These are the most useful commands to start working with it:

* Packaging: mvn -P optimize
* Run: java -jar passwordcard.jar <properties_path>
* Exit: press the middle mouse button over the tray icon.
* Configuration: see the passwordcard.properties file as a reference to create your own configuration.

For more information you can refer to the original README file.

h1. Prerequisites

To compile and run the project you will need JDK 7. Also to build the project you will need Maven 3, you can also use Maven 2 modifying the POM (that's up to you).

h1. Notice

This project also contains code and/or resources of:

RUNNING THE CODE

You will need to have Java installed in order to run this code, which you can
get here: http://www.java.com/.

Note that this code is not intended as a tool for daily usage or a replacement
for the web site. It is only intended as a demonstration of how to use the code
and as a backup of last resort. If the web site ever does disappear, the hope is
that this code will be used to create a new tool or web site to replace it.
Because of this the tool is extremely rudimentary.

To run it, change the current directory to the directory containing
PasswordCard.jar and execute the following command:

java -jar PasswordCard.jar <card number> [ --digitArea ] [ -- includeSymbols ]

Where <card number> is the hexadecimal card number printed on the card, and
--digitArea and --includeSymbols are optional parameters respectively to include
an area containing only digits on the card and to include symbols on the card
in addition to letters and digits.

The contents of the card will be written to standard out. If you want to capture
them in a file you can use the redirection operator by appending something like
this to the command line given above:

> passwordcard.txt


CHARACTER ENCODING

The source code files, including this README file, are encoded with UTF-8. Take
this into account when opening them, or when trying to compile them! The javac
command has an -encoding parameter with which you can indicate the encoding of
the source file.

Similarly, the demonstration code described above also uses the UTF-8 encoding
for its output. If your terminal or console settings are not configured for
UTF-8, the output may appear distorted. It is best to capture the output to a
file, as described above.


FONT

To print a card correctly you would need a non-proportional font containing at
least all the symbols used by PasswordCard. The font used by the web site is
the FreeMono font from the GNU FreeFont project, which can be downloaded here:
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/freefont/


COLOURS

The web site colours the lines of the password card as follows:

header: white
line 1: white
line 2: grey
line 3: red
line 4: green
line 5: yellow
line 6: blue
line 7: magenta
line 8: cyan


EXAMPLE

As an example, here are the contents of card "0". You can use this to check
whether your implementation of the algorithm is correct, or whether your Java
VM implements the API in the same way as the Sun VM:
